# Joann Jun
## Hello, welcome to my page!

Hi! I’m Joann Jun, a Statistical Data Science student at the University of Connecticut with strong experience in data wrangling, statistical modeling, and machine learning. I enjoy turning complex datasets into clear insights and building intuitive visualizations in R and Python.

My work spans predictive analytics, spatial analysis, mixed models, and experimental design. I’ve also explored healthcare applications—especially maternal health and mental health disparities—through projects in the UnitedHealth Group Bridges to Healthcare Technology Program.

I’m passionate about using data to promote fairness, improve decision-making, and make technology more accessible.

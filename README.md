# Introduction:
My name is Joann Jun and I am currently a junior pursuing a BS in Statistical Data Science at the University of Connecticut. I am also minoring in mathematics. During my time at UCONN I have taken up some leadership roles including being the treasurer for the Joint Statistical Club, fundraising chair for the Korean Student Association, and a mentoring role for the Asian/Asian Amercan Mentoring Program.

I am interested in.
